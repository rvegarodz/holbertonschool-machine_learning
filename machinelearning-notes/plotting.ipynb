    "- It is similar to a scatter plot except that the measurement points are ordered (typically by their x-axis value) and joined with straight line segments. \n",
    "- A line chart is often used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time – a time series – thus the line is often drawn chronologically. In these cases they are known as run charts."
